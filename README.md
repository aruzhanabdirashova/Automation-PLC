This project implements an automated bottle filling and capping system controlled by a Siemens PLC. It utilizes sensors, a conveyor belt, and motorized valves to ensure precise and efficient operation. The system was programmed using TIA Portal with Ladder Logic and SFC diagrams, showcasing the benefits of automation, such as increased efficiency, consistent product quality, and reduced labor costs. Future improvements may include faster filling mechanisms, additional sensors, and integration with Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs).
